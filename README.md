# Lilly Estética

This is the source code for the new Lilly Estética website.

## First step

You need to install all dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

If you have some problem with the installation of the dependencies, try to run:

```bash
node --dns-result-order=ipv4first $(which npm) install
```

You can set an alias to improve your work flow:

```bash
alias npm='node --dns-result-order=ipv4first /usr/local/bin/npm'
alias npx='node --dns-result-order=ipv4first /usr/local/bin/npx'
```
